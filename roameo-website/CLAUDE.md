# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` (runs on port 5050)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Preview production build**: `npm run preview`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint` (uses ESLint with auto-fix)
- **Format code**: `npm run format` (uses Prettier on src/ directory)

## Architecture Overview

This is a Vue 3 SPA (Single Page Application) for Roameo, a travel booking platform, built with Vite and TailwindCSS.

### Key Technologies
- **Vue 3** with Options API and Composition API support
- **Vue Router 4** for client-side routing
- **Vite** as build tool and dev server
- **TailwindCSS 4.x** for styling with custom breakpoints
- **Vuex 4** for state management with persistence
- **@vueuse/motion** for scroll-based animations with custom mixins
- **vue-lazyload-next** for image optimization with background image support
- **Swiper.js** for carousel/slider functionality with infinite loop, autoplay and custom navigation
- **@vuepic/vue-datepicker** for advanced date picker functionality with custom styling
- **@headlessui/vue** for accessible UI components (Combobox, etc.)
- **vue-select** for enhanced select components

### Project Structure
- `src/views/` - Top-level view components (MainView, ErrorView)
- `src/pages/` - Page components rendered within views (MainPage)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components (NavbarComponent, FooterComponent, FlightBookingForm, AccordionComponent)
- `src/sections/` - Page section components (PartnerSection, DestinationSection, GoNextSection, FeatureStaySection, TravelJourney, TopTravelTea, RoameoTv, FeaturedEpisode, TestimonialsSection, NewsletterSection, FaqSection)
- `src/mixins/` - Reusable Vue mixins (useMotion.js for consistent animation patterns)
- `src/router/` - Vue Router configuration with nested routing
- `src/assets/` - Static assets including SVG icons, images, and video thumbnails

### Routing Architecture
- Uses nested routing with MainView as the parent component
- Home route (`/`) aliases to `/home` and renders MainPage
- 404 handling via catch-all route that renders ErrorView
- Router configured with history mode and `/app` base URL
- Auto-scroll to top on route changes

### Styling Setup
- TailwindCSS with custom screen breakpoints (xs: 375px, 2xl: 1440px, 3xl: 1536px, 4xl: 1920px)
- Custom font family: Plus Jakarta Sans
- Global styles in `src/style.css`

### Build Configuration
- Vite with Vue plugin and development tools
- Path alias `@` points to `src/` directory
- Development server runs on host `0.0.0.0:5050`
- Vercel deployment configuration for SPA routing

### State Management
- Vuex store with persistence using vuex-persistedstate
- Encrypted storage capabilities via encrypt-storage package

### Animation & Motion System

#### Custom Motion Mixin (`src/mixins/useMotion.js`)
All section components implement a unified animation system via the `useMotion` mixin, providing:

- **getSlideUpMotion(delay, distance, mass)**: Basic slide-up animation with spring physics
  - Uses `visibleOnce` trigger for scroll-based activation
  - Default: 160px distance, moderate spring settings
  - Customizable delay for staggered animations

- **getScrollSlideUpMotion(delay, distance, mass)**: Enhanced scroll-triggered slide-up
  - Optimized for scroll interactions with refined spring physics
  - Variable mass parameter for different animation feels
  - Default: 160px distance with balanced spring/damping

- **getScrollSlideUpMotionBounce(delay, distance)**: Bouncy variant for emphasis
  - Higher stiffness (400) and mass (1) for pronounced bounce effect
  - Perfect for headers, badges, and attention-drawing elements
  - Enhanced visual impact with spring overshoot

- **getScrollFadeInMotion(delay)**: Simple opacity-only animation
  - Smooth fade-in effect without movement
  - Ideal for backgrounds, overlays, and subtle reveals
  - High stiffness (300) for crisp fade transitions

#### Motion Implementation Pattern
```vue
<!-- All section components follow this pattern -->
<template>
  <div v-motion="getScrollSlideUpMotion(200)">Content</div>
</template>

<script>
import { useMotion } from '@/mixins/useMotion.js'

export default {
  mixins: [ useMotion ],
  // ... component logic
}
</script>
```

#### Animation Timing Strategy
- **Staggered Delays**: Elements animate in sequence (100ms, 150ms, 200ms, etc.)
- **Section Coordination**: Each section has coordinated animation timing
- **Performance**: Uses `visibleOnce` to prevent re-animations on scroll
- **Accessibility**: Respects user motion preferences

### Current Development Focus
The application now features a comprehensive landing page with 11 distinct sections, each implementing consistent scroll-based animations through the unified `useMotion` mixin system. Recent developments include:

- **Complete Section Architecture**: All major landing page sections implemented with responsive design
- **Unified Animation System**: Custom motion mixin providing 4 distinct animation types with spring physics
- **Advanced Carousel Implementation**: Multiple Swiper configurations including infinite loops, continuous auto-scroll, and pause-on-hover
- **Glass Morphism Design**: Consistent backdrop-blur effects across multiple sections for modern aesthetic
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Coordinated animations, staggered reveals, and interactive feedback throughout
- **Mobile-First Responsive**: All sections optimized for mobile with proper touch interactions and breakpoints

The project emphasizes performance with `visibleOnce` animations, accessibility with motion preferences, and maintainability through the mixin pattern for consistent behavior across all section components.

### Best Practices

#### Animation Implementation
- **Always use useMotion mixin**: Import and apply to all section components for consistency
- **Staggered timing**: Use incremental delays (50ms increments) for related elements
- **Animation types**: Choose appropriate motion type based on element importance
  - `getScrollSlideUpMotion()` for standard elements
  - `getScrollSlideUpMotionBounce()` for emphasis/headers
  - `getScrollFadeInMotion()` for backgrounds/subtle elements
- **Performance**: Use `visibleOnce` to prevent re-animations on scroll

#### Carousel Implementation
- **Infinite loops**: Enable `loop: true` for seamless cycling experience
- **Pause on hover**: Always implement `pauseOnMouseEnter: true` for better UX
- **Custom navigation**: Position navigation arrows contextually within each section
- **Responsive slides**: Configure breakpoints for different screen sizes
- **Auto-scroll variations**: Use appropriate speeds (1ms for continuous, 3500-4000ms for standard)

#### Visual Design
- **Glass morphism**: Use `bg-white/40 backdrop-blur-sm` for consistent card effects
- **Color consistency**: Stick to defined color palette (#1A94FF primary, #FFE759 accents)
- **Rounded corners**: Use 1.5rem standard, larger for special elements
- **Hover effects**: Implement scale (1.02-1.05) and shadow transforms consistently

#### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 48px for interactive elements
- **Breakpoint strategy**: Use custom TailwindCSS breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- **Content flow**: Ensure logical content order on all screen sizes

#### Component Architecture
- **Mixin pattern**: Use mixins for shared functionality across components
- **Section isolation**: Each section should be self-contained with minimal dependencies
- **Lazy loading**: Implement for images and heavy content
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels, focus states, and motion preferences
